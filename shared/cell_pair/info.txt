Files correspond to the simulation scripts for cell pair on a patterned (rectangular) substrate simulation,
and a paraview state file to visualize the traction map as in the journal submission.

As set, a 5h10min (simulated time) simulation of a cell pair is run with the following parameter values:

kECM = 1.0e-2 N/m
zeta_AJ = 0.0

Output is in the form of VTP files, such that the evolution of the simulation can be visualized in Paraview.

4 VTP file is created per simulated minute, with * indicating the minute (0-309):
- cell_cell_fibers_*.vtp        (contains data to visualize fibers)
- cell_cell_nodes_*.vtp         (contains data to visualize cell nodes and focal adhesions)
- cell_cell_triangles_*.vtp     (contains data to visualize cell triangles and distinct cell parts, i.e. lamellipodium and lamellum)
- ground_ground_triangles_*.vtp (contains data to visualize substrate plane and create traction map based on force saved per triangle)

Three files are included:

- multCellSpr.py            (simulation script)
- PyCmdsMultSim.py          (additional functions used in simulation which are written in Python, not Mpacts commands).
- supplementary_videos.pvsm (Paraview state file, can be loaded to visualize cell pair and traction map as in the supplementary videos in the journal submission)

To run simulation enter in command line:
python multCellSpr.py
